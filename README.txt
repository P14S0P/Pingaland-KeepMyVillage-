# Pingaland - KeepMyVillage

A small mod that gives villagers a voice to protect their homes!

*KeepMyVillage* is a simple, server-friendly mod designed to prevent players in survival mode from breaking or griefing vanilla villages. Any attempt to break a block within a village's boundaries will be cancelled. Instead, the player will be met with a unique, colorful warning from a randomly-named villager, accompanied by an angry sound. 

Players in creative mode are unaffected, allowing for easy administration and building.

## Features
- 🛡️ **Village Protection:** No block within a village can be broken by non-creative players.
- 💬 **Dynamic Warnings:** Receive unique, colored chat messages from villagers defending their property.
- 🔊 **Custom Sounds:** Plays one of several custom angry villager sounds upon a failed break attempt.
- 🎨 **Creative Mode Bypass:** Players in Creative mode can build and break blocks normally.
