Hey! That's not yours!
Get your hands off our property!
Don't even think about it.
We built this village, not you!
This is a peaceful village. No vandals allowed!
Stop that right now!
I'm warning you...
Put that back!
This is our home, show some respect!
I'm going to tell the Iron Golem on you!
Do you mind? We live here!
STAPPPPPP!
Go find your own resources out in the wild!
The nerve of some players...
That has been there for generations!
Did anyone say you could tear our town apart?
Our trading prices for you just went way up!
What are you doing?!
This is not a mine.
Every block here has its place.
Have you no decency?
Vandal! Go away!
We will not tolerate this!
Consider this your final warning.
Don't make me raise my prices.
My grandfather placed that!
This behavior is unacceptable.
